1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
- They sometimes won’t show up at the place where you want, mainly because of other elements positioning. Padding is the distance from border to content. It is useful for me to set border as dashed on an element that i am working on, it gives me a clear vision how this element is being changed. Margin has very lots to do with elements positioning.
