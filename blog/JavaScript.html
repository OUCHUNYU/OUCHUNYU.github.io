    <h2>Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects</h2>
    <p>I have just started my learning on JavaScript this week, it feels pretty cool, i personal like it. I had always been curious about JavaScript as now days every web developer talks about how cool it is. Well finally i officially started it, also as my second scripting language. It all feels pretty cool, surprisingly i don’t feel much different from my first scripting language Ruby. </p>

    <p>So far i have gone through first 4 chapters of book Eloquent JavaScript. This books is highly recommended if you have not read it and you want to get started with JavaScript as well. I don’t know about online interactive coding practice website such as Codeacademy. I have used it before for Ruby, now i don’t know if i would suggest that, because it sets every thing for you, which in my opinion you should hard code it yourself, struggle a bit, get stuck a bit, then you know next time. But, just personally how i feel about it, you can’t totally go with it, if you feel more comfortable to get started with that.</p>

    <p>Like i said, i have only finished first 4 chapters with JavaScript, i know that i have really limited knowledge about it. But from what i have read and how i felt, i would like to do a little review about what i learnt and what felt different from Ruby since they are both popular these days in Web Development, and why i feel they are really similar. </p>

    <p>Mainly i’m interested in Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects. They visually look very much the same thing, because their syntax distinctly different from each other so they both work awesomely in their own ways.</p>

    <p>In my option, although they look so close, Ruby Hashes work more like a its purpose, they are data structures. JavaScript Objects work just like how they are defined, objects. In JavaScript, what i have read so far, methods are considered as properties of an object and variables. So when you defined a new function for a JavaScript object you have the function defined for that object, and you can access that function to have some use for that. But in Ruby Hashes, you can’t do that, you can technically assign a function you defined to a key in a hash, but what that key is going to hold is only the value of that function, which means, if your function prints a string, that key is going to return you a string, not the function itself. More obvious, when your function takes argument and you want to assign this function to a key in a Ruby Hash, you must supply all arguments it needs, otherwise Ruby console gives you an ArgumentError. Which really tells you that Ruby hash keys only hold value of an object. In JavaScript it holds the entire function, and you can call that function or even pass argument to it. Here are some example code we can see the differences.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>No matter what language you are learning, it must consists of those basic stuff of a computer language, such as Strings, Numbers, Boolean, Arrays, Objects, Libraries(Hashes), Classes and so on. Make sure you have very good understanding of what they are and what they do. Then you are able to learn any computer programming languages out there.</p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        # Ruby Code:

        def sum(num1, num2)    # sum function hash two parameters
          num1 + num2
        end

        my_hash = {a: "apple", b: "bb", c: sum}   # Note we don't give arguments
      </code>
    </pre>

    <pre><code>
        ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 2)
          from (irb):14:in `sum'
          from (irb):17
    </code></pre>

    <p>However, this is not the case in JavaScript</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        // JavaScript Code

        var myObject = {
        a: "apple",
        b: "bb",
        c: function sum(num1, num2) {      // note we define the function right in
             return num1 + num2;           // the object body
           }
        };
      </code>
    </pre>

    <pre><code>
      // Here we have no problem from JavaScript console.

       undefined

      // if we call this object
      > myObject.c(1, 2)
       3
    </code></pre>

    <p>The results are clear as water. Because their syntax are different so they have different uses. In my option, Rub Hashes in Ruby just to serve the purpose of being a data container. They contain data as objects inside of they, so we can use all those beautiful functions to manipulate with them. JavaScript Object, first of all they are called Object, not Hashes, although they look similar, we should not even compare them. JavaScript Object serve the purpose of being objects. If you really want to associate them with Ruby stuff, you can think JavaScript Objects are like Ruby hash and Module combination. They hold data, and they hole functions. Both of data and functions are properties of an Object in JavaScript.</p>
