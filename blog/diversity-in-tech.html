        <h2>Diversity of Tech Industry</h2>
        <P>As we move along with DBC and going deeper each day in to software development and IT industry. It is now more important to keep track of news in this business and just to stay updated. As a requirement and also my interest, i have a little research on what the diversity is like in now  days in tech industry.</p>
        <p>A very informative chart from <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/">Information is Beautiful</a>:</p>
        <img src="http://infobeautiful4.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/1276_Diversity-In-Tech.png">
        <p><a href="file:///Users/ChuchaandMasha/Desktop/OUCHUNYU.github.io/blog/diversity-in-tech.html">The original post here</a></p>
        <p>This chart tells now days in those tech leader companies we are having more employees that from different ethnic group other than white people, than ever before, but still we don't see any significant gain. Which in my opinion still a little bit colorless based on some other information i gathered here:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>According to the Computing Research Association, in 2013, 4.5% of all new recipients of bachelor's degrees in computer science or computer engineering from prestigious research universities were African American, and 6.5% were Hispanic.</p></li>
          <li><p>On average, in 2014 only about 2% of technology workers at seven Silicon Valley companies that had released staffing numbers were black and only 3% were Hispanic.</p></li>
          <li><p>In general, Blacks and Hispanics only represent 9.2% of the tech industry.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This chart also reflects the fact that we have lack of women in the industry. Although we are definitely seeing more women tech summit, conferences, meet ups happening around the country, but still in general women coder number is too little than what we normally imagine. Here are some other facts i gathered about women in tech: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Of the 26% total women that made up the computer workforce in 2013, Black women only made up 3%, Asian women made up 5%, and Hispanic women made up 2%</p></li>
          <li><p>Women are leaving this field.</p></li>
          <li><p>The hostile work environments for women in tech.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The huge problem for the tech economy. According to the industry group Code.org, computing jobs will more than double by 2020, to 1.4 million. So that an already dire shortage of qualified tech workers will grow worse. We do see the tech leading companies start donating to programs, but just important to know the problems are still serious. </p>
