    <p>Reflection on Responsive Web Design:</p>
    <p>This bonus challenge requires me to read thru many resources. The challenge itself pretty simple as the page i generate is small and simple. But i did feel i learned a lot. Through this challenge seems like i have got the responsive design basics setup, which i am sure will save my time and efforts later. Here is my reflection about the responsive design. Responsive design is a set of techniques and ideas rather than all in one magic button. The idea here is to create reusable code and more flexible pattern of webs, to suit an ever-changing industry. We can expect to see new devices with new size screens coming up more often than ever before, in order to suit all size of screen out in market and future devices we must to create 'smart' websites. There are (at least) two techniques working together allows us to generate 'smart' websites(For now, who knows about couple three years later.) . First, we can use fluid gird which for my understanding is to change fixed pixel number in our code to corresponding proportional numbers. We can archive this by finding our target's container first, the thing where our target embedded in. And then using this formula: target pixels / container pixels * 100%. The result should be the number we want. Second, we can use css media queries to set a condition that tells our code when to use a different style sheet. For example, when fluid grid zooms too small on a small screen mobile device for users to see, this is when that condition we set comes in to play. Let's say i set the condition when width smaller than 600 pix, we release a css sheet. then you get on your iPhone to connect to this web, your phone screen smaller than 600pix in width, you will get a different css.</p>
