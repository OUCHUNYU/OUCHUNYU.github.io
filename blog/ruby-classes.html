      <h2>Let’s Create a Ruby Class and Use It</h2>
      <p>When you are learning Ruby, you are definitely impressed by how dynamic this languages is. There are so much things going on and because of its dynamic features, it is powerful. There is no best programming language, it is all about how you, as a programmer feel about it. Personally i really like using Ruby to script up some fun projects, because it is just fun to mess around with it. Today, i would like to show you one of my favorite feature in Ruby, Ruby Class.</p>
      <p>Well, of course is not Ruby’s feature only, any programming language has classes. But Ruby’s class is bit different and lots of fun. A Ruby class is a blueprint for a set of objects. Because we have some objects that have same functionalities, so we use class to kind of group them together, so it can produce new objects that will have the functions introduced in this blueprint. Let's see some code example.</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          class Person
            def initialize
              @name = nil
              @height = nil
              @weight = nil
            end
          end
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>As code example above, we create a person class. In this class we have a initialize instance method that defines 3 instance variables name, height, weight. We can now use person class method new to create a new person and it will have 3 attributes that are equal to nil means nothing. This is not really close to what we want this class to do. What we want is to have this class create a new person with personal name, height and wight. This is when instance methods come in play. Lets define some instance methods.</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          class Person

            def name=(person_name)
              @name = person_name
            end

            def height=(person_height)
              @height = person_height
            end

            def weight=(person_weight)
              @weight = person_weight
            end

          end
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>One more thing to say about Ruby dynamics. See the example code above we directly open up the person class again just like that and add anything we like to it, then close it up with end keyword. Cool! So, we have defined 3 new methods for corresponding instance variables defined in the initialize instance method, note that initialize method auto runs when never we generate a new instance of person class with class method new. All 3 new methods are commonly called setter methods, because they use Ruby syntax sugar = sign and takes a argument and use the argument to set new value associated to the instance variables. Here also tells us why instance variables are useful in class definition. See that once an instance variable is defined inside an instance method, then all other instance methods from this class get to use the instance variable. In which case a local variable can not do the same, it belongs to its own scope. Now we can use this class to produce a new person with all 3 attributes we want this person to have.</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          john = Person.new
          john.name = "John"
          john.height = "180cm"
          john.weight = "70kg"
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Just to create a person is not enough, we want Ruby to tell us about this person, what this person is like. Now lets make our class speak. So we need to open this class again and make it to have more functions.</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          class Person

            def name
              puts @name
            end

            def height
              puts @height
            end

            def weight
              puts @weight
            end

          end
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Now let's aks Ruby in bash.</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
irb(main):004:0> john = Person.new
=> #<Person:0x007ffe509ddd38>
irb(main):005:0> john.name = "John"
=> "John"
irb(main):006:0> john.height = "180cm"
=> "180cm"
irb(main):007:0> john.weight = "70kg"
=> "70kg"
irb(main):008:0> john.name
=> "John"
irb(main):009:0> john.height
=> "180cm"
irb(main):010:0> john.weight
=> "70kg"
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Okey that was quit like a robot. Let's make our sentence more human like.</p>
      <pre><code>irb(main):011:0> "Hi everyone, my name is #{john.name}, my height is #{john.height}, my weight is #{john.weight}."</code></pre>
      <p>Here Ruby says:</p>
      <pre><code>=> "Hi everyone, my name is John, my height is 180cm, my weight is 70kg."</code></pre>

      <p>Happy coding.</p>
