    <h1>A Little diving into Responsive Design Basics</h1>
    <p>As my software engineering progress moving on, i have a clearer mind that this career is about using the knowledge we have to build a better, more creative, more intelligent world. If we narrow this prospective down, if we just simply talk about web development world(Because i am currently with my DBC mentors). The point making it more creative, more intelligent should all start with User Interface design, for front and back end development. Simply we can not avoid website responsiveness as a very important aspect of User Interface Design. Therefor, i had a little diving into this aspect as a response to my DBC bonus challenges and for my own good.</p>
    <p>Here i have a little reflection on this topic and a simple fixed layout page which i transformed into a more user friendly web page. I put those two in <a href="responsive-design-basics/index.html">one page</a>, click to check out. The raw code is visible on <a href="https://github.com/OUCHUNYU/OUCHUNYU.github.io/blob/master/blog/responsive-design-basics/stylesheet.css">GitHub</a> if you are interested.</p>
